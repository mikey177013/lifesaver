## 🧠 Overview

**RescueNow** (formerly *LifeSaver*) is a smart, one-tap emergency response web app designed to **instantly alert trusted contacts, share live location, and provide AI-powered guidance** during critical moments.

Built using **Emergent.sh AI** and modern web technologies, RescueNow is lightweight, fast, and works even with limited connectivity — ensuring help is *always* within reach.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In real-world emergencies, victims often:
- Panic or don’t know what to do next  
- Waste time explaining their situation  
- Can’t quickly share their exact location  

**RescueNow** solves this by combining **AI guidance**, **live geolocation**, and **instant alerts** — turning your browser into a personal safety assistant.
